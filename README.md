# CODSOFT-ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-GAME

## Project Overview
The Codsoft Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a Python-based interactive desktop application that lets users play the classic game against the computer. It is developed using Python with a Tkinter GUI for a colorful and engaging experience.

This project was created as part of the Codsoft Internship (Python Programming). It applies concepts such as GUI programming, randomization, modular design, and game logic to build a simple yet professional game application.

## Objective
The main objective is to demonstrate how Python can be used to design a fun, user-friendly, and visually appealing desktop game. The project showcases not only logical implementation but also the importance of an interactive interface.

## Features
- Play against the computer (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- Instant result display (Win / Lose / Tie).
- Score tracking across multiple rounds.
- Reset Game option to restart from scratch.
- Modular code with reusable functions.
- Colorful Tkinter GUI for better experience.

## User Interface & Color Theme
The game window has been designed with bright colors and modern layout to maximize engagement:
- Title Bar → Maroon background with bold white text.
- Status Display → Green background showing the last round result.
- Scoreboard → Yellow banner showing round number and scores.
- Buttons:
- Rock → Red button
- Paper → Light Blue button
- Scissors → Green button
- Reset Game → Orange button

This lively theme makes the game more fun compared to plain console output.

## How It Works
1. User selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking a button.
2. The computer randomly chooses one option.
3. Game rules are applied:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beat Paper
- Paper beats Rock
4. Result and updated scores are displayed instantly.
5. Player can continue multiple rounds or reset anytime.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.13.7.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the script:
python rock_paper_scissors.py
4. Play using the buttons in the GUI.

## Conclusion
The Codsoft Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a beginner-friendly yet professional project that combines logic, design, and interactivity. With its colorful GUI, real-time scoring, and modular code.

This project successfully demonstrates Python’s potential for game development and highlights the importance of UI design in enhancing user experience.
